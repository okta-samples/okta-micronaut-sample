# Okta Micronaut Sample

This example shows you how to use the [Micronaut's OAuth 2.0 support](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#oauth) to login a user. The login is achieved through the [Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcode/main/) where the user is redirected to the Okta-Hosted login page. After the user authenticates, they are redirected back to the application and a local cookie session is created.

It also shows how to return the user's information from an API using an OAuth 2.0 access token.

## Prerequisites

Before running this sample, you will need the following:

* [Java 17+](https://sdkman.io/jdks)
* [The Okta CLI Tool](https://github.com/okta/okta-cli/#installation)
* An Okta Developer Account, create one using `okta register`, or configure an existing one with `okta login`

## Get the Code

Grab and configure this project using `okta start micronaut`.

You can also clone this repo and run `okta start` in it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-micronaut-sample.git
cd okta-micronaut-sample
okta start
```

## Enable Refresh Token

Sign into your [Okta Developer Edition account](https://developer.okta.com/login/) to add a required setting to your Micronaut Okta app to avoid third-party cookies. Navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and select "okta-micronaut-sample" application to edit. Find the **General Settings** and press **Edit**. Enable **Refresh Token** in the **Grant type** section. **Save** your changes.

## Run the Example

```bash
source .okta.env
```

### Maven

Run the application with Maven
```
./mvnw mn:run
```

The application uses [Micronaut Ahead-of-time optimizations (AOT) optimizations via the Micronaut Maven Plugin](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-maven-plugin/latest/examples/aot.html). You can enable [Micronaut Security AOT optimizations](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/#aot) in `aot-jar.properties`.

### Gradle

Run the application via the [Micronaut Application Gradle Plugin](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-gradle-plugin/latest/).  

```
./gradlew run
```

Or, run an optimized JAR with Gradle:

```
./gradle optimizedRun
```

Log in at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Access with OAuth 2.0

You can also retrieve user information from the `/hello` endpoint with an OAuth 2.0 access token.

First, you'll need to generate an access token.

1. Run `okta apps create spa`. Set `oidcdebugger` as an app name and press **Enter**.

2. Use `https://oidcdebugger.com/debug` for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to `https://oidcdebugger.com`.

3. Navigate to the [OpenID Connect Debugger website](https://oidcdebugger.com/).

    1. Fill in your client ID
    2. Use `https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize` for the Authorize URI
    3. Use `openid offline_access` for the Scope 
    4. Select **code** for the response type and **Use PKCE**
    5. Click **Send Request** to continue

4. Set the access token as a `TOKEN` environment variable in a terminal window.

       TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJYa2pXdjMzTDRBYU1ZSzNGM...

5. Test the API with [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/cli) and an access token.

       http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"
